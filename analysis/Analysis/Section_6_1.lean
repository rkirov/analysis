# Analysis I, Section 6.1: Convergence and limit laws

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Definition of $ε$-closeness, $ε$-steadiness, and their eventual counterparts.
- Notion of a Cauchy sequence, convergent sequence, and bounded sequence of reals.

  all quantities are real instead of rational.

  Definition 6.1.3 (Sequence). This is similar to the Chapter 5 sequence, except that now the
  sequence is real-valued. As with Chapter 5, we start sequences from 0 by default.
