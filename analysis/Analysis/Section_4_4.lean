# Analysis I, Section 4.4: gaps in the rational numbers

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter.  In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Irrationality of √2, and related facts about the rational numbers

Many of the results here can be established more quickly by relying more heavily on the Mathlib
API; one can set oneself the exercise of doing so.

## Tips from past users

Users of the companion who have completed the exercises in this section are welcome to send their tips for future users in this section as PRs.
